# Covered Call Research Findings
**Date: April 26, 2025**

## Market Analysis

### Current Tariff Environment
Our research has revealed significant market disruption caused by recent tariff implementations from the Trump administration:

- Base 10% tariff on all imports (effective April 5, 2025)
- Country-specific tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% for major trading partners
- A particularly high 104% tariff on goods from China
- Certain electronics exempted from "reciprocal" tariffs as of April 11

The implementation of these tariffs has caused substantial market volatility, with major indices experiencing dramatic swings. The S&P 500 posted its third-largest single-day advance since World War II on April 9th after the White House announced a 90-day pause on larger tariffs for the majority of U.S. trade partners (excluding China). This rally followed a four-session slide after the April 2nd announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs.

### Economic Impact
The tariffs are projected to have significant economic effects:
- Expected to increase federal tax revenues by $166.6 billion (0.55% of GDP) in 2025
- Represents the largest tax hike since 1993
- Average tax increase of nearly $1,300 per US household
- Weighted average applied tariff rate rising to 25.8%
- Projected to cause imports to fall by nearly $800 billion (23%) in 2025

## Sector Impact Assessment

Based on our analysis, sectors are being affected differently based on their exposure to international trade:

### Negatively Impacted Sectors
- **Technology**: High foreign supply chain exposure, potential China IP implications
- **Materials**: Directly affected by aluminum and steel tariffs
- **Consumer Discretionary**: Import-dependent with price sensitivity, particularly those serving lower-income consumers
- **Industrials**: Global supply chain disruption, especially companies with significant operations in China

### Potentially Benefiting Sectors
- **Utilities**: Domestic focus, defensive nature, regulated returns
- **Healthcare**: Essential services, relatively insulated from trade disputes
- **Oil & Gas**: Domestic production emphasis, potential energy independence focus
- **Financials**: Regulatory easing under current administration
- **Domestic Restaurant Chains**: Less import dependence than other consumer sectors

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend the following implementation approach:

### Entry Timing
- Execute all positions at market open on Monday, April 28, 2025
- Use limit orders slightly above the current ask prices for stock purchases
- Use limit orders at the midpoint of option bid-ask spreads for option sales

### Position Sizing
- For a $100,000 portfolio, allocate approximately 30-35% to each position
- Ensure appropriate diversification across the three sectors (energy, financial, utility)

### Exit Strategies
- **Primary Plan**: Allow assignment at expiration if stocks close above strike prices
- **Alternative**: If significant market changes occur before expiration, consider early closure or roll
- **Stop-Loss Strategy**: Consider closing positions if underlying drops more than 7% from entry

## Risk Assessment

Our analysis identified the following risks to this strategy:

### Market Risks
- **Tariff Policy Shifts**: Sudden changes in tariff stance could cause market rotation
- **Sector-Specific Issues**: Regulatory changes or industry challenges could affect individual positions
- **General Market Decline**: While selected sectors are defensive, a broad market selloff could still impact prices

### Mitigating Factors
- Selected stocks have strong fundamentals to weather volatility
- Dividend yields provide income regardless of market movements
- Option premiums offer modest downside protection
- Diversification across different defensive sectors reduces concentrated risk

## Conclusion

Our research confirms that the current tariff environment creates viable opportunities for covered call strategies on defensive stocks with domestic focus. The selected positions meet the target 8-12% annualized return goal specified in our strategy while maintaining appropriate risk management through sector diversification and strong underlying fundamentals.

We recommend proceeding with implementation of the three identified covered call positions as outlined above, with a review after the May expiration cycle to assess performance and determine if continued tariff impacts warrant maintaining similar positions or adjusting our approach based on evolving market conditions.
